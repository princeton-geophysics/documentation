# Introduction to `conda`

This is the repository associated to the PICScIE Spring Workshop 2022 
'Introduction to Conda'.

The repo is divided into two sections `docs/`, which are the notes on various 
conda related topics, and `python-package`, which is a mini bare-bone python
package that is used as an example for creating your own conda package.

The full documentation for the course is located here:

## Workshop's goals

Providing you with the tools to make your software reproducible and impart 
some knowledge to you on how to publish your software using conda

* Understanding what
    * a package is
    * a package manager is
    * motivates the use of a package manager
* Some environment knowledge
    * How to create an environment 
    * How to work with files describing an environment (`environment.yml`)
    * Reproduce an environment
* Some package knowledge
    * How to install packages
    * How to create your own package
    * How to publish your own package

## ***Not*** workshop goals

* Make you a Python wizard
* Teach you how to make a Python Package, even though we are doing it
* Completely `conda`-ify all of your software - that would be post workshop work
