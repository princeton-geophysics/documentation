# Limit the number of concurrent jobs in the terminal

This is a function I found on 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1537956/bash-limit-the-number-of-concurrent-jobs>),
that seems to do the trick. It is `user3769065`'s answer bulding on 
`tangens`'s answer. It defines a function that contains a `while` loop that
will loop until less than a given concurrent jobs are executed. 
So, if it is executed after every single background task is placed it will 
simply start every job until a given limit is reached s


```bash
job_limit () {
    # Test for single positive integer input
    if (( $# == 1 )) && [[ $1 =~ ^[1-9][0-9]*$ ]]
    then

        # Check number of running jobs
        joblist=($(jobs -rp))

        # Loop to heck whether jobs are still running
        while (( ${#joblist[*]} >= $1 ))
        do

            # Wait for any job to finish
            command='wait '${joblist[0]}
            for job in ${joblist[@]:1}
            do
                command+=' || wait '$job
            done
            eval $command
            joblist=($(jobs -rp))

        done
    fi
}
```

and the function is used as follows:

```bash
while :
do
    <some_task> &
    job_limit <nproc>
done
```

***NOTE***: It should be noted that we can combine both the job_limit and the 
status check. See below
