# Visual Studio Code

VSCode is a cross-platform IDE. So, off the bat it works on all machines. At its
core it's extremely simple and does minimal text editing. However, it is highly
customizable through professional and community-based extensions. Through these
extensions it has incredible support for almost all languages, and other
customization such at specific keybindings for your most loved editors, e.g. Vim
and Emacs. Other things worth highlighting are:

- Full Latex IDE support with LaTeX Workshop Extensions
- Full git support, the integrated command line makes it easy to commit and 
  upload your changes.
- Full Python IDE support with the Python Extensions
- Full Julia IDE development: https://www.julia-vscode.org/
- [Remote Development Extension](./remotecodeediting.md)
